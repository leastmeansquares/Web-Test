                            Before arranging a viewing on a property, you will be asked a series of questions to
                            help us assess your eligibility to apply for a property you are interested in. It is important that
                            information given is accurate as this will determine your eligibility not only to view the property but
                            also in being successful in any future application.

                            <hr>

                            We will normally try to arrange viewings individually but sometimes we may need to
                            arrange consecutive (20-minute increments) or block viewings. Regardless of the
                            number of viewers, it is recommended that you register your interest in the property as soon as
                            possible thereafter. A rental guide will be provided available on request or on the website.

                            <hr>

                            Please inform us of your intention to apply for the property. You will be sent an
                            online application form and detailed information and links about the tenancy. Please ensure you have
                            all the supporting documentation ready which can be uploaded via your application form.

                            Our online digital forms allow our
                            prospective tenants to submit their online applications and uploads much faster than a traditional
                            process, resulting in quicker decisions and less time wasted or a property empty for longer. Likewise,
                            all our forms can be completed and signed online which benefits the whole letting process from start
                            to finish.

                            - You fail to take all reasonable steps to enter into a Tenancy Agreement (thereafter).
                            <br><br>
                            Should any of the above conditions apply which results in the holding deposit being retained, you will
                            be notified of this promptly with a full explanation. If a holding deposit is to be returned at this stage,

                            <br><br>

                            A Guarantor may be a pre-requisite for application for some tenants and would need to go through the
                            referencing system with regards to acceptance and should be employed and/or homeowner.

                            <br><br>

                            A Guarantor may potentially still be accepted if the referencing criteria fails, however, if it is suspected
                            prior to applying, this should be discussed before applying as no guarantee will be given that a
                            landlord will accept a Guarantor retrospectively, resulting in rejection. Cases will be assessed
                            independently.

                            <br><br>

                            Holding Deposit:

                            <br><br>

                            A holding deposit of one-weeks rent will be payable immediately on application. The property
                            will be put on hold (up to 15 days) until the referencing is completed. No further applications
                            will be processed during this period. If the application is successful, you will then need to pay
                            a Security Deposit (Bond) for the property and sign a Tenancy Agreement, along with
                            additional tenants and any guarantors. The bond amount is equivalent to five-weeks rent.

                            A successful application will be confirmed in writing along with the next steps, commitments
                            and timescales. We will work to provisional dates given in your application (unless other
                            dates are agreed).

                            We will prepare Tenancy Agreements, Inventory & Property Condition Reports and book an
                            appointment at the property to complete a physical check-in (in person). By doing this we are
                            able to discuss and assist with any questions you may have and sign any agreements or
                            Inventory that may not have been signed up to this point. If anyone has difficulty attending 
                            check-in day, we can work round this so long as we know in advance.

                            Therefore, the total costs will be the rent still contractually due (which will be no more than the maximum amount of rent outstanding on the tenancy given its earliest termination) plus the landlord’s comparable costs to re-let.

                            Tenants are responsible for loss or damage to keys, fobs and security devices whilst in their care.
                            These items can be very difficult to identify and expensive to replace, individually or as a set or suite (key alike) should there be a security risk to the property or building. Costs will be attributed to the tenants if lost so special care is recommended with this in mind. A reasonable administration fee is also levied upon the tenant by the agent for time taken to rectify or attend replacements. This is charges at £20.00 per hour.

This charge will be £20.00 and will be levied immediately or retrospectively from the security deposit. The inspection will still need to be completed.
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Formal Letters:</span><br>
                            If the agent fails to get a response from the tenant through normal channels of communication (for any reason), which include mobile phone, email or WhatsApp a formal letter may be sent to try and establish why communications has been unsuccessful.
                            The agent reserves the right to charge the tenant £5.00 per formal letter.
